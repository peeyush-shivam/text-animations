# Project Submission: Animated Text Particle System

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a React-based animated text particle system that allows users to input text phrases and watch them animate across a beautiful forest background with various animation paths. The application features a landing page for text input and an animation view with floating text elements and particle effects.

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Component Memoization** - All components use React.memo()
2. **Hook Optimizations** - useCallback and useMemo throughout
3. **Animation Performance** - Reduced particle count and FPS
4. **Bundle Optimization** - Code splitting and tree shaking
5. **Memory Management** - Proper cleanup of animation frames

### Performance Metrics

- **Particle Count**: Reduced from 400 to 200
- **FPS Limit**: Reduced from 60 to 30 for particles
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized through code splitting and dependency cleanup
- **Re-renders**: Minimized through memoization
- **Dependencies**: Removed 2 unused packages (framer-motion, tsparticles)
